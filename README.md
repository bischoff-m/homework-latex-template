# Homework Latex Template

Put your name and student ID in the `Latex/preamble.tex` file. You can create a new folder
for each homework and put the `main<N>.tex` file in it.

## VS Code as Latex Editor

If you want to use VS Code as your Latex editor, I recommend the following toolchain:

- [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/download)
- [Strawberry Perl](http://strawberryperl.com/)
- [LaTeX Workshop](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop)
